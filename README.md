1. App.java: This is the entry point of the application. It extends the Application class from JavaFX and defines the start method, which is called when the application is launched. It sets up the main stage and invokes the showScreenApplications method from the ScreenApplicationManager class.

2. ScreenApplication.java: This class represents an individual screen application. It takes a Screen object and a device number as parameters. It creates a stage for the screen, sets its properties, and creates a root layout (a VBox) containing the display device number, a button, and the message text. The button toggles the visibility of the message text. The screen application can be shown by calling the show method.

3. ScreenApplicationManager.java: This class manages the screen applications. It gets a list of screens using the Screen.getScreens() method and iterates over them. For each screen, it creates a ScreenApplication instance and calls its show method.

4. WebsiteOpener.java: This class provides a utility method to open a web page in a new window. It utilizes the JavaFX WebView and WebEngine classes to load and display the web page.

The overall flow of the program is as follows:

1. The App class is launched, which creates a new instance of ScreenApplicationManager and calls its showScreenApplications method.

2. The ScreenApplicationManager class retrieves a list of screens and creates a ScreenApplication for each screen, passing the corresponding screen and device number.

3. The ScreenApplication class creates a stage for each screen, sets up the UI elements (device number, button, and message text), and defines the button's action to toggle the visibility of the message text.

4. When the program is run, each screen's application is shown, displaying the device number and a button to toggle the visibility of the message text.

Please ensure that you have Java and the JavaFX SDK properly installed, and set up the CLASSPATH environment variable to include the JavaFX libraries. This will allow the program to compile and run successfully.
